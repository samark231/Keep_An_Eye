Since many years I have been following the way they organize contents in the news it interests me to read.

And this review is after 1 hour installing the app. Keep up HT. Be ethical as always:) I have been using TOI app for quite some time but I found TOI is has now downgraded it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s services by being biased and over prided for nothing, flying high for nothing. Now I am using Hindustan Times which is providing every minute news and that too in elaborate manner hence I would recommend HT to general public at large and must stop going for TOI. In Hindustan Times you will find Hinduism and service to Humanity. Go for HT. I am using on the latest version of ios and latest app upgrade.

Apple Intelligence is the easy-to-use personal intelligence system that delivers helpful and relevant intelligence while taking an extraordinary step forward for privacy in AI. Now users can explore creative new ways to express themselves visually with Image Playground, create the perfect emoji for any situation with Genmoji, and make their writing even more dynamic with new enhancements to Writing Tools. Building on Apple Intelligence, users with an iPhone 16 or iPhone 16 Pro can instantly learn more about their surroundings with visual intelligence with Camera Control. And now with ChatGPT integrated into Writing Tools and Siri, users can tap into ChatGPT\u2019s expertise without having to switch between apps,\u00a0helping them get things done faster and easier than ever before. Today, Apple Intelligence also begins language expansion with localized English support for Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, and the U.K., giving even more users around the world powerful new ways to use their iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Additional languages, including Chinese, English (India), English (Singapore), French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, and Vietnamese will be coming throughout the year, with an initial setarriving in a software update in April. Design Fun, Original Images with Image Playground The Image Playground experience allows users to easily create fun and unique images, with concepts like themes, costumes, accessories, and places. Users can add their own text descriptions, and can even create images in the likeness of a family member or friend using photos from their photo library. Image Playground generates images in distinct styles, including Animation \u2014 a modern, 3D-animated look \u2014 and Illustration, which offers images with simple shapes, clear lines, and colorblocking. The experience is integrated right into Messages, making it easier than ever to create images for conversations, as well as into apps like Freeform, Keynote, and many others. Image Playground is also available as a brand-new dedicated app. Create Genmoji to Fit Any Moment With the power of Apple Intelligence, emoji is taken to the next level with Genmoji,\u00a0making conversations with family and friends more fun and playful, and opening up entirely new ways to communicate. By simply typing a description into the emoji keyboard, a Genmoji will appear, including multiple options to choose from. With images from their photo library, users can take Genmoji even further by creating one that is inspired by a friend or family member. Personalized Genmoji can be customized with accessories, like a hat or sunglasses, and can reflect themes or activities to make them even more personal and unique. Just like emoji, Genmoji can be added inline to messages, or shared as a sticker or reaction in a Tapback.1 Take Notes to the Next Level with Image Wand The Notes app gets new tools to make note-taking more visual and dynamic. With Image Wand in the tool palette, users can quickly create images in their note using the written or visual context already captured within the note. Image Wand transforms a rough sketch into a polished image by simply circling it. Users can even circle empty space within a note, and Image Wand will gather context from the surrounding area \u2014\u00a0using on-device generative models to analyze the handwritten or typed text \u2014 to create a relevant image that complements the note and makes it more visual. Users can create images with the Animation, Illustration, and an additional Sketch style in Image Wand. Describe Changes in Writing Tools Writing Tools build on the existing options of Rewrite, Proofread, and Summarize with the new ability for users to specify the change they\u2019d like to make, using the new Describe Your Change option. Describe Your Change gives users even more flexibility and control when they\u2019d like to make their writing sound more expressive, such as to add more dynamic action words to their resume or even rewrite a dinner party invitation in the form of a poem, and more. Just like all of the features with Writing Tools, this new Describe Your Change option is available systemwide across Apple and many third-party apps. Learn More About Surroundings in One Click with Visual\u00a0Intelligence A new visual intelligence experience builds on Apple Intelligence and helps users learn about objects and places instantly, thanks to the new Camera Control on the iPhone 16 lineup. Visual intelligence can summarize and copy text, translate text between languages, detect phone numbers or email addresses with the option to add to contacts, and more. Camera Control also allows users to search Google so they can see where they can buy an item, or benefit from ChatGPT\u2019s problem-solving skills to ask for an explanation about a complex diagram, such as from class notes. Users are in control of when third-party tools are used and what information is shared. Tap into ChatGPT with Siri and Writing Tools Apple is enabling ChatGPT access in Siri and Writing Tools experiences within iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, allowing users to access its expertise \u2014 as well as its image- and document-understanding capabilities \u2014 without needing to jump between applications. With the ChatGPT integration, Siri can suggest a user access ChatGPT for certain requests, and Siri can provide the response directly. With Compose, users can ask ChatGPT to generate content for anything they are writing about from the systemwide Writing Tools. They can also use ChatGPT\u2019s image-generation capabilities to add images alongside their written content. Users can choose whether to enable ChatGPT integration, and are in full control of when to use it and what information is shared with ChatGPT. By default, a ChatGPT account is not required to use this integration. When using ChatGPT without an account, OpenAI will not store requests, and will not use the data for model training. Additionally, users\u2019 IP addresses are obscured to prevent their sessions from being linked together. For those who choose to connect their account, OpenAI\u2019s data-use policies apply. Even More Capabilities Coming Soon Additional Apple Intelligence capabilities will be available in the months to come. Siri will be even more capable, with the ability to draw on a user\u2019s personal context to deliver intelligence that\u2019s tailored to them. Siri will also gain onscreen awareness, and will be able to take hundreds of new actions in and across Apple and third-party apps. Priority Notifications will also surface what\u2019s most important. In addition, users will be able to create images in Image Playground in a Sketch style, an academic and highly detailed style that uses a vibrant color palette combined with technical lines to produce realistic drawings. A Breakthrough for Privacy in AI Designed to protect users\u2019 privacy at every step, Apple Intelligence uses on-device processing, meaning that many of the models that power it run entirely on device. For requests that require access to larger models, Private Cloud Compute extends the privacy and security of iPhone into the cloud to unlock even more intelligence. When using Private Cloud Compute, users\u2019 data is never stored or shared with Apple; it is used only to fulfill their request. Independent experts can inspect the code that runs on Apple silicon servers to continuously verify this privacy promise, and are already doing so. This is an extraordinary step forward for privacy in AI. nhaija@apple.com Apple Media Helpline media.help@apple.com Images in this article Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984.

I love the new layout, but there is just one problem.My iPad doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get push notifications despite me setting that up and I have the same app on my iPhone and it DOES give me push notifications, which, I have set up.I guess my advice is: please bring back push notifications for iPad. I downloaded the app yesterday after reading a story on Facebook by CTGN. The first thing that made me wonder did I download an ad blocker on my phone? No. Who sponsored this so that it was ad free? I guess the Chinese Govt. If that is what they do, and I get to read various news stories without ads ever, I LOVE it! I can not even begin to tell you how many stories I just stop reading because hundreds of ads, accidentally clicking on them and getting frustrated because I can not get back to the story. I am so over being bombarded by ads of products I would never buy. Thanks for a clean news source.Is their anyway to add weather to it? I would never have to go anyplace else. I am in the USA so it would be great. Thanks again.Just to be clear no fees? No monthly sub? And no ads? Where has this kind of news been? Nice app, pleasing to view. Lots of news groups have these things, why use this one? Living in the USA I find myself more and more disdainful of the inept, highly opinionated and barefaced biases found on all the major (and lesser!) news sources here and western countries in general. They all have pretty apps too. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m still in the first few days of trying this CGTN, hoping to find less opinions and just the facts. I can form my own opinions. So far it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going ok. The opinion articles are clearly labeled as such in the headline. The live TV feature works well. So far my personal jury is still out as to whether or not CGTN will deliver the news in the manner I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m seeking but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m giving them a good try and hoping for the best. Best of luck to them and thanks for their hard work.Update after using a while...Seeing many of the usual biases on USA reports. They parrot U.S. msm sources. Noticed the last story read was actually an AP story. I must assume the reports on China are similarly slanted. Deleted from device.
