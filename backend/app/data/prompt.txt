caution: sincce i am using api call to get your reponse in python , the response that you send , i am going to prase it in my python code with json.loads. hence if you add any extra word i will get and my code will fail so if you have to say anything your side of the thing should be only in the third element of array which will be string . this is the most important thing DO NOT ADD EVEN A SIGLE WORD IN THE FRONT OR BACK OF ARRAY. i know the api respnse is a string always so i will parse using json.loads but if the reponse that i get from the api call is not of  "[[], "", ""]" format i my code will faill hence only say your side of things in the third element of the array.
here is the input array:
{input_array}
